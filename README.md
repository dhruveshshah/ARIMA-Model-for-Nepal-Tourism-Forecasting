# ARIMA-Model-for-Nepal-Tourism-Forecasting
Building a ARIMA model from 22 years of data to forecast Nepal Tourism for next 5 years 

I have used ARIMA model to forecast next 5 years values for Nepal tourism.
Tested the model using aic and bic information criterion.
Performed Residual Diagnostic using Ljung box test for auto correlation and finding autocorrelation factor to check for ARCH effect.
Used Jarque-Bera test to check for residual distribution
